# Personnal_Projects_Recipe_Database
The following repository holds projects and other files used in the creation of programming projects on my own personal time.  

The 'Recipe_Database', is a directory of Java and MySQL code, establishing Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), to access the
'Local Instance MySQL80' database to store, insert, and retrieve data on different recipes, located in the databases' schemas.
The project helped me understand and develop new concepts and techniques such as GUI Programming and JDBC, while also improving
my Java programming skills.
