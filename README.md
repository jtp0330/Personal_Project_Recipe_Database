# Personnal_Projects_Recipe_Database
The following repository holds my first project to be developed on my own personal time.  
The 'Recipe_Database', is a directory of programs created in Java by establishing Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), to access the
'Local Instance MySQL80' database to store, insert, and retrieve data on different recipes, located in the databases' schemas, 'recipes.'
The project helped me understand and develop new concepts and techniques such as GUI Programming and JDBC, while also improving
my Java programming skills.

This is a practice commit so I can get familiar with GitHub mechanics.
